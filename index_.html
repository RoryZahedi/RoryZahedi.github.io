      Hello! I am a computer science graduate student at UCSB, where I am pursuing my M.S. focusing
      in computer systems. For my research, I am working under my advisor Professor Jonathan Balkind,
      in UCSB's Arch Lab, where I'll be conducting research in the exciting world of computer architecture. <br><br>

      Recently I have just finished my Bachelors at UCSB as part of the BS/MS program in March 2022, and I am anticiapting to graduate
      with my master's this upcoming Spring, 2023. As such, I am currently searching for new graduate roles that emphasize in
      computer networks, robotics, cloud technology, mobile WiFi/bluetooth, computer architecture, and systems work in general.<br><br>

      This website is a current work in progress but feel free to check out the related tabs above for more
      information about my projects, resume, teaching and more!

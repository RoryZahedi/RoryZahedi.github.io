      <h3> C. Steet @ 6:45AM </h3>
      <p>Day 2 of the run of swell for the week, my friends and I decided to hit C. street<br>

        <br>
        With the another solid west swell at 4.6ft @10s (279 deg.) and slight onshore winds of 2knots, C. Street seems like it should be super fun.
        <br><br>Surf forecast predicted similar conditions as did MSW; truly a rare occurance for the three sites to have the same prediction at least for central coast.

        <br><br>
        <strong>Prediction:</strong>7-8/10

      <h2>Wed. April 12th, 2023</h2>
      <h3> Sands @ 6:40AM </h3>
      <p>After a bit of a flat spell, surf forecast, surfline, and the buoys showed promising waves for Goleta with a solid West swell of 2.6ft @ 10s with onshore winds at 3 knots <br>

        <br>
        With a decent west with longer period, I thought devs would be fun enough to ride on a midlength but once I woke up and checked the buoy to see
        a wind wave height of 7.2ft, I knew it was gonna be mushy and boy was I right.
        <br><br>Devs was maybe 2 ft tops at the bigger sets and super mushy. Thankfully though Sands was bigger with sets in the 3-4ft range offering some of the best rights I've seen at sands all year since they actually stayed open.

        Because of the mush from the wind, it was still a bit hard to scrape into the waves especially on my epoxy shortboard, but overall it was pretyt fun.

      <h2>January 5th, 2023 Santa Barbara Swell</h2>
      <p>This day was crazy. Santa Cruz and SF was flooding, SD had 30 ft bombs, and SB even had some tow-in waves. <br> Here's some clips from that day with spots ranging from Rincon to more up North<p>

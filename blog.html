    <p>Welcome to my page! I'll mainly be writing about surf reports and exploring some spots in CA, but maybe some other things too down the line.

      I am by no means a pro-surfer or even that experienced in the large scope of things, so take all the ratings with a grain of salt as they're in my perspective.
      <br>Additionally, the ratings I give are per spot. So a 8/10 at a poor beach break could be a 3/10 at a good pointbreak.

      <h3> C. Steet @ 7:30am </h3>
      <p>Day 2 of the run of swell for the week, my friends and I decided to hit C. street<br>
        <img src="images/april13Surfline.png" alt="surfline report">
        <br>
        With the another solid west swell at 4.6ft @10s (279 deg.) and slight onshore winds of 2knots, C. Street seems like it should be super fun.
        <br><br>Surf forecast predicted similar conditions as did MSW; truly a rare occurance for the three sites to have the same prediction at least for central coast.

        <br><br>
        <strong>Prediction:</strong>7-8/10
        <br>
        Upon pulling off the 101S for C-steet, I was greeted by some nice looking lines which was a good sign for the surf
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        Once I was suited up and paddling out, the forecast looked like it was a true 3-4' ft but it had way more texture from the wind than 2kts.
        <br>
        Despite the always annoying ripcurrent pulling you towards the pier, there were still a few fun waves to be had until the wind really picked up around 9 and blew everything but the tip of the point out.

        Even on a bad day at C-street, I'll still get 2-3x longer rides than at my local so even though it was fun, not the great conditions I was hoping for.

      <h3> Sands @ 6:40AM </h3>
      <p>After a bit of a flat spell, surf forecast, surfline, and the buoys showed promising waves for Goleta with a solid West swell of 2.6ft @ 10s with onshore winds at 3 knots <br>
        <img src="images/april12Surfline.png" alt="image1">
        <br>
        With a decent west with longer period, I thought devs would be fun enough to ride on a midlength but once I woke up and checked the buoy to see
        a wind wave height of 7.2ft, I knew it was gonna be mushy and boy was I right.
        <br><br>Devs was maybe 2 ft tops at the bigger sets and super mushy. Thankfully though Sands was bigger with sets in the 3-4ft range offering some of the best rights I've seen at sands all year since they actually stayed open.

        Because of the mush from the wind, it was still a bit hard to scrape into the waves especially on my epoxy shortboard, but overall it was pretyt fun.

      <h2>January 5th, 2023 Santa Barbara Swell</h2>
      <p>This day was crazy. Santa Cruz and SF was flooding, SD had 30 ft bombs, and SB even had some tow-in waves. <br> Here's some clips from that day with spots ranging from Rincon to more up North<p>
